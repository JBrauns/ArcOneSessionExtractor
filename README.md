# Arc One Utility Library
This python module contains methods to extract data out of the ArcONE csv session files. Because the UI frontend that comes with the ArcONE lacks some
capabilities in batch exporting multiple samples or even lacking a workng export at all this library can be used to fix the missing features. It can
parse the underlying csv data and produce arc testmodule specific python objects out of it. These you can either store in another format or use graphics
libraries like numpy to generate plots in batch mode.

## Arc Parser
The arc parser is the module responsible for reading in the csv file(s) and processing it into python objects. Basis of this module is the 'GetArcElements'
function which returns all known arc testmodules it found in the given file content. The fileContent passed to this function shall be generated by the
'GetFileContent' function from the file_system.py module.

### Usage
```python
rootPath = "C:/stdp"
fileFilter = r'.*trace_[0-9]+_.*'
logFile = open('log.json', 'w')

# NOTE(joshua): The 2 is only temporarily during development. Be advised to remove it in future
fileContents = fsys.GetFileContent(rootPath, fileFilter, 'csv', 2)
for arcElement in arcp.GetArcElements(fileContent, logFile):
    # NOTE(joshua): Analyze the elements data, generate plots, ...
    if(arcElement.Type == arcp.ArcElementType.Retention):
        ...

logFile.close()
```
